Project Summary:
This project is a mock Sudoku website built using only HTML and CSS. It includes multiple pages such as a home page, game selection page, easy and hard Sudoku game pages, rules, leaderboard, login, and registration pages. The website focuses on layout, visual structure, and responsive and mobile friendly design.

1. What was the most challenging part of this assignment?

The most challenging part of this assignment was building a visually correct Sudoku grid using only HTML and CSS, without relying on JavaScript. In particular, creating a 9×9 grid with clearly separated 3×3 sub-grids required careful reasoning about CSS Grid layout and border alignment. The syntax itself is straightforward, but achieving precise layout control and responsiveness without any scripting required deeper understanding of CSS features such as grid, flexbox.

2. What decisions did you make to adapt your website for mobile devices?

To make the website mobile-friendly, I prioritized responsive layout rather than creating separate mobile pages. I used flexible layouts (Flexbox and CSS Grid) so that content could adapt naturally to smaller screen sizes. I also added media queries to scale down the Sudoku grid and ensure that navigation elements remain accessible on mobile devices. I tested the site using Chrome DevTools with the iPhone 12 Pro preset to verify that the layout remained usable and readable.

3. What factors did you consider when designing your website, and what are you proud of?

When designing the website, I focused on clarity, consistency, and usability. I wanted all pages to share a unified navigation bar and visual style so that users could easily understand how to move between different sections. I also paid attention to semantic HTML structure and clear class naming to keep the code maintainable. One aspect I am particularly proud of is the Sudoku grid itself. Achieving a correctly aligned 9×9 grid with bold 3×3 sub-grid borders using CSS required careful planning and debugging, and the final result closely resembles a real Sudoku game.

4. What additional features would you add if you had more time or resources?

If I had more time or resources, I would add JavaScript-based interactivity to make the Sudoku game fully playable. This would include input validation, real-time error highlighting, and automatic checking of completed puzzles. I would also implement a functional timer and difficulty-based puzzle generation.

In addition, I would add user authentication logic so that login and registration pages become functional. A persistent leaderboard backed by a database would also improve the realism and completeness of the website.

5. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

Approximately 20 hours.
